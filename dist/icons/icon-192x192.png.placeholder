This is a placeholder file.

To generate the actual icons, you can:

1. Use the generate-icons.js script (requires Node.js and the canvas package)
2. Create your own custom icons using a design tool like Figma, Photoshop, etc.

A proper PWA requires icons in various sizes as specified in the manifest.json file.
